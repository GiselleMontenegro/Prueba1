This is an introductory course to the development of control software for robotic platforms. Along the course you will learn how to configure and use simulation environments to prototype the control software for mobile robotic platforms such as the [Summit-XL](smt.md) and the [foot-bot](fbot.md).

The course is divided in two parts. The first part corresponds to the development of control software for mobile robots by using the Robot Operating System and the Gazebo simulator. The second part addresses the design of control software for robot swarms using the ARGoS simulator. Each part of the course is divided in three practical sessions and one project.

### Preparing the materials for the course

The course begins with the section [Getting Started](gst.md). There, you will find all relevant information to prepare and setup your computer for the practical sessions. It is expected that you have a computer that is ready to work by the day of the first session.

### Development of the course

The schedule of the practical sessions is indicated below.

#### Part 1 - Mobile robotics

- [(P1.1) Teleoperation](p11.md)
- [(P1.2) Mapping](p12.md)
- [(P1.3) Path planning](p13.md)
- [(P1.4) Project: Cooperative box-pushing ](mrproject.md)
<!-- - [(P1.5) TODO](https://dgarzonramos.github.io/robotics/p15): June 5, 2020. -->

#### Part 2 - Swarm robotics

- [(P2.1) Random walk](p21.md)
- [(P2.2) Aggregation](p22.md)
- [(P2.3) Pattern formation](p23.md)
- [(P2.4) Project: Foraging with forbidden areas](srproject.md)
<!-- [(P2.4) Consensus achievement](https://dgarzonramos.github.io/robotics/p24): June 11, 2020. -->
<!--- [(P2.5) Synchronization](https://dgarzonramos.github.io/robotics/p25): June 12, 2020. -->
